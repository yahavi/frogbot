## ü§ñ What is Frogbot?

Frogbot is a Git bot that scans your pull requests for security vulnerabilities using [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) . Frogbot adds the scan results as a comment on the pull request. If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot will also add a comment, confirming this.
Please note that GitHub and GitLab are currently supported and Bitbucket will be supported soon.
Projects that use one of the following tools to download their dependencies are currently supported.

- Npm
- Maven
- Gradle
- Go
- Pip
- Pipenv
- Nuget
- Dotnet

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è How does it work?

### General

For security reasons, Frogbot is not triggered automatically.
After you create a new pull request, the maintainer of the git repository can trigger Frogbot to scan the pull request from the pull request UI. The scan output will include only new vulnerabilities added by the pull request. Vulnerabilities that aren't new, and existed in the code prior to the pull request creation, will not be included in the report.

### GitHub

1. A developer opens a pull request.
2. The Frogbot workflow automatically gets triggered and a [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment) named _frogbot_ is pending for the maintainer's approval: 

[![](./images/github-pending-deployment.png)](#running-frogbot-on-github)

3. A Maintainer reviews the pull request and approves the scan: [![](./images/github-deployment.gif)](#running-frogbot-on-github)
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by repeating steps 2 and 3.

### GitLab

1. A developer opens a merge request.
2. A maintainer of the repository triggers the manual **frogbot-scan** job.
3. Frogbot is triggered by the job, scans the merge request, and adds a comment with the scan results.
4. Frogbot can be triggered again following new commits, by triggering the **frogbot-scan** job again.

### Pull Request Comments

#### üëç No issues

If no new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot automatically adds the following comment to the pull request:

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfrog/frogbot/master/resources/noVulnerabilityBanner.png)](#-no-issues)

#### üëé Issues were found

If new vulnerabilities are found, Frogbot adds them as a comment on the pull request. For example:

## üñ•Ô∏è Installing and Using Frogbot

### General

1. Frogbot requires a JFrog environment to scan pull requests. Don't have a JFrog environment? No problem - [Set Up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud](#set-up-a-free-jfrog-environment-in-the-cloud). You'll later save the connection details (URL, username, and password) as secrets in Git.
2. Setting up Frogbot on a GitHub repository? [Install Frogbot using GitHub Actions](#install-frogbot-using-github-actions)
3. Setting up Frogbot on a GitLab repository? [Install Frogbot using GitLab CI](#install-frogbot-using-gitlab-ci)

### Set up a FREE JFrog Environment in the Cloud

Need a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud, so Frogbot can scan your pull requests?

Just run one of the following commands in your terminal, to set up an environment in less than a minute. The commands will do the following:

1. Install [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI) on your machine.
2. Create a FREE JFrog environment in the cloud for you.

After the set up is complete, you'll receive an email with your JFrog environment connection details, which you can then store as secrets in Git.

**On MacOS and Linux using cUrl**

```
curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io?setup | sh
```

**On Windows using PowerShell**

```
powershell "Start-Process -Wait -Verb RunAs powershell '-NoProfile iwr https://releases.jfrog.io/artifactory/jfrog-cli/v2-jf/[RELEASE]/jfrog-cli-windows-amd64/jf.exe -OutFile $env:SYSTEMROOT\system32\jf.exe'" ; jf setup
```

### Install Frogbot Using GitHub Actions

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Create a new "frogbot" [GitHub environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment#creating-an-environment)

   1. Add people or public teams as reviewers. The chosen reviewers are authorized to trigger Frogbot scan on pull requests.
   2. Save the JFrog connection details as secrets in the environment with the following names - **JF_URL**, **JF_USER**, and **JF_PASSWORD** (You can also use **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** instead of **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD**).

   ![](images/github-environment.png)

3. Use one of these [GitHub Actions templates](templates/github-actions/README.md#frogbot-gitHub-actions-templates) to create a file named `frogbot.yml`.
4. Push the `frogbot.yml` file to the `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your GitHub repository.

### Install Frogbot Using GitLab CI

1. Make sure you have the connection details of your JFrog environment.
2. Save the JFrog connection details as secrets in GitLab with the following names: _JF_URL_, _JF_USER_ and _JF_PASSWORD_ (You can also use _JF_ACCESS_TOKEN_ instead of _JF_USER_ and _JF_PASSWORD_).
3. Add a job named `frogbot-scan` to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab repository using the below structure.

**Important Guidelines**

- For npm, pip, pipenv, nuget or dotnet: Make sure to set the command in a way that it downloads your project dependencies as the value of the **JF_INSTALL_DEPS_CMD** variable. For example, `npm i` or `nuget restore`
- Make sure that either **JF_USER** and **JF_PASSWORD** or **JF_ACCESS_TOKEN** are set, but not both.
